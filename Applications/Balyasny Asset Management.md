### Why do you want to work here?
- I have always been interested in problem solving, and was interested in finance but preferred CS, I went to Amazon to learn about general coding practices, but now that I'm at 2 years, I think it's time to get back into the finance sector and see how I can apply what I've learned.
- The market is the most complex data-driven problem out there, and opportunities to help build services that empower people to tackle this problem, or even to help sift through the data to make the right decisions sounds very rewarding,
- I also saw the focus on low-latency and I have found that constraints like that force coders to be more thoughtful and are forced to innovate more in the role
- Have had experience with concurrency related algorithms
