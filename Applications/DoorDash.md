INTERVIEW FORMAT
The screen will be 60-minutes and generally structured as follows:
• Introductions between you and your interviewer (5 min)
• Working session of CodePair, answering coding questions (45 min)
• Q&A and opportunity for you to ask your interviewer about DoorDash (10 min)

YOU WILL NEED:
• A computer with internet access. Your recruiter will send you a CodePair link to use for the
coding portion of the interview.
• A reliable internet connection for Zoom audio. Having cellular reception as backup is ideal.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
• Questions should be easy to understand over audio (i.e. should not require diagrams or
drawings).
• DoorDash interviewees are being assessed on their communication and ability to write code.
• Interviewers will set clear parameters and expectations for you.

MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE ASSESSMENT INCLUDE:
• We will be evaluating your knowledge of CS fundamentals, textbook algorithms, and data
structures.
• Coding Fluency & Style of Code
• Organize your code, test, and debug, and know your language of choice well.
• Algorithms & Data Structure
• Understand common data structures and use cases for them (listed below).
• Thinking & Communication
• Walk through your thought process out loud and be prepared to talk through
optimizations/time and space complexities after implementation
