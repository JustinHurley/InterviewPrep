#### Heaps
Heaps, AKA priority queues, are tree-based data structures that satisfy the [[#heap property]]. They are particularly useful when you want to prioritize nodes on a given characteristic, typically max or min value. This is because the tree data structure allows for you to find the max or min value in constant time. 

#### Heap Property
The heap property ensures that the root node is the highest-priority node, where that priority is dependent on some relative characteristic.
**Example**
- Max heap: parents > children
- Min heap: parents < children
