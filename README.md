Hello! 

I made this repository as a place to put the notes I've taken throughout my interview prep process.
It's a combination of LeetCode problem write-ups, System Design notes, some templates for reaching out to recruiters, and more.

I've figured since I've spent so much time on this stuff, maybe someone also looking for Software Engineering Interview prep resources would find it useful.
Feel free to ask questions or leave comments on anything you see in the repo, and I'll be happy to try and get back to you.
I try to do the daily LeetCode problem and do a writeup on it (unless I forget or the problem is very trivial).

I use Obsidian, a Markdown formatter to store most of my notes, which is why the formatting is the way it is. 
The best way to view this content is with an application that can render `.md` files.

TLDR; 
This repo has:
- LeetCode problem write-ups
- Algorithm and category notes
- System design notes
- My application tracking stats (this one is mostly for me but could be a good reference)
- Templates to add new notes
- Notes for specific job applications
