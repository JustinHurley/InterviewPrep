# Content Delivery Network
A CDN is a group of geographically distributed proxy servers. A **proxy server** is an intermediate server between a client and the origin server. The proxy servers are placed on the network edge. As the network edge is close to the end users, the placement of proxy servers helps quickly deliver the content to the end users by reducing latency and saving bandwidth. A CDN has added intelligence on top of being a simple proxy server.
## Main Idea
- It takes time to send things far away
- We can add proxy servers to distribute content so we aren't sending things as far away
