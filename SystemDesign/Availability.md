# Availability 
Availability is just the percentage of time that a service or infrastructure is available to clients. 
- A service with 100% availability would work as intended 100% of the time
- A service with 0% availability would never work as intended 

### Formula
$$A = \frac{Total\  Time - Time\ Service\  Was\  Down}{Total\  Time} * 100 \%$$
