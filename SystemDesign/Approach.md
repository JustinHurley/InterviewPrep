# System Design Interview Approach
You should be doing these 3 things in every System design interview
### 1. Solidify the Requirements
- Interview questions are left purposely vague to allow room for the interviewee to ask questions
- Ask refining questions
	- (Functional) Determine requirements needed directly by clients, e.g. the ability so send messages in real-time
	- (Non-Functional) Determine requirements needed by the service owners, e.g. not having the service degrade as it scales 
### 2. Scope the Problem
- You don't need to add every feature to have a valid answer
- Check with your interviewer what things you can leave out
- You will most likely have 30-45 minutes to complete the interview so be aware of that
### 3. Engage the Interviewer 

## Factors to Keep in Mind
- **Robustness** (ability to continue to function in during a crisis/outage)
- **Scalability**
- **Availability**
- **Performance**
- **Extensibility**
- **Resiliency** (ability to get back to normal after a service disruption)
