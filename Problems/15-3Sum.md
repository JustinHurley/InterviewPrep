### 15. 3 Sum

Link: [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/description/)

#### Problem
Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

#### Approach
You can treat this like 2 Sum but with a little extra twist. In this case, since we always want it to add to 0, we can itertate through the array, pull out a number from the list, subtract it from 0, then try to use the rest of the numbers in the list to add up the the target value that is equal to `0 - nums[i]`. 
We use the 2 pointer technique to find the value, moving either the left side or right side in depending on how the current sum is relative to the target `0 - nums[i]` sum. 
In the solution below, a `set()` is used to prevent duplicates, but there are other ways to do this that don't require the instantiation of a set. For example, since the list is already sorted, we can just check for duplicates after a triplet is found, and advance the left and right pointers until we get a new number, but there are multiple approaches. 

**Non-Set Approach**
While using the set and tuples is nice and prevents us from adding the same set of values twice, if there was a way we could avoid adding duplicates to the set in the first place, then we could improve performance (non-asymptotic). 
The main difference is just the addition of a few lines of code to ensure that we aren't handling duplicates. The first part of these checks is in the for loop, where we look to see if the current element is not equal to the previous one. We then also check after adding an answer to the answer list, if by iterating we are dealing with the same value again, since we sorted the array earlier. 

#### Solution
```python 
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = set()
        length = len(nums)
        # Sort list so we can do 2 ptrs
        nums.sort()

        # Iterate through given set - 2 so there's room for 3 ints
        for i in range(length-2):
            currNum = nums[i]

            left = i+1
            right = length-1
            # Now try to find a sum that matches the target
            while left < right: 
                # If we found the target
                if nums[left] + nums[right] + currNum == 0:
                    ans.add((currNum, nums[left], nums[right]))
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1
                # If l+r are greater than the target, move the right down
                elif nums[left] + nums[right] > -currNum:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    left1 += 1
        return list(ans)
```

**Solution without sets and tuples**
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        nums.sort()
        ans = []

        for i in range(n-2):
            # Skips duplicates
            if i == 0 or nums[i-1] != nums[i]:
                l, r = i+1, n-1
                while l < r:
                    curr = nums[l] + nums[r]
                    if curr > -nums[i]:
                        r -= 1
                    elif curr < -nums[i]:
                        l += 1
                    else:
                        ans.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])
                        l += 1
                        r -= 1
                        # If we just appended and are still looking at a duplicate
                        while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l-1]:
                            l += 1
        return ans
```

#### Time Complexity
`O(n^2)` since `n` to iterate through each element, and then times `n` each time for the two sum implementation.
