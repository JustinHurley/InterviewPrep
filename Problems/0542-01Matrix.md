# 542. 01 Matrix
Link: [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/description/)
## Problem
Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return _the distance of the nearest_ `0` _for each cell_.
The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.
## Main Idea
- We can use BFS starting from the 0s to find the distance to the other values
## Approach
- We will use a deque for BFS
- We need to make a copy of the input matrix to store the answer
- We seed the queue with the coordinates of all the 0s
- The queue processes by distance, so we process all elements of distance 2 before distance 3
- If a coordinate is in bounds and also hasn't been visited yet, then we should update the answer matrix with the value
## Edge Cases/Gotchas 
- Not making a deep copy will cause problems
- You need a `seen` set so you don't get caught in a loop
## Solution
```python 
class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        rows, cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        Q = deque()
        seen = set()
        # Dupe to hold ans
        ans = [row[:] for row in mat]
        adj = [(0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (1, 0)]

        # Checks if OOB
        def isValid(row, col):
            if row < 0 or row >= rows or col < 0 or col >= cols:
                return False
            return True
        # Add 0s to Q
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if mat[r][c] == 0:
                    Q.appendleft((r, c))

        dist = 0
        while Q:
            # 'Snapshots' the len value 
            for _ in range(len(Q)): 
                coord = Q.pop()
                # If not processed yet
                if isValid(coord[0], coord[1]) and (coord[0], coord[1]) not in seen:
                    ans[coord[0]][coord[1]] = dist
                    seen.add((coord[0],coord[1]))
                    # Adds neighbors to Q
                    for dr, dc in adj:
                        Q.appendleft((coord[0]+dr, coord[1]+dc))
            dist += 1
        return ans
```
## Time Complexity
`O(m*n)` we process every element once, and add it's 4 neighbors to the queue so 5 calls per item (ignoring the setup scans)
## Space Complexity
`O(m*n)` we store data in a copy of the input matrix so it would make sense the answer is of the same size
